Title: "Week01 - Orient"
---

#We will focus on the following questions:

1.1 What is your background?

Task: No matter what we do in our lives, we already use tools to perform our work in education.  Please reflect on what’s in your own toolkit.  Is it full of outdated tools that should be discarded? What is the latest tool you’ve added?

1.2 What are your learning objectives?

Task: Formulate some objectives that will create value for your professional/personal development.  If possible we will try to merge different ideas and perspectives to a common goal with this course.
